## ‚ú® Photon State Tomography
In chapter 3 of the PhD thesis [eth-6886-02] by Christopher Eichler, submitted to ETH Zurich, discusses photon state tomography and its technical details.
I read the thesis and in this repo, I provide tools to implement the calculations of photon state tomography based on his method, in python.

## üìù Overview of photon state tomography

In short, photon state tomography reconstructs quantum states using statistical data from qubit emissions $S = a + h^\dagger$, while $a$ is qubit mode and $h$ is noise. 
With methods to account for noise contributions, it can determining qubit moments $\langle a^{\dagger n} a^m \rangle$, the Wigner function $W(\alpha)$, and the density matrix $\rho$.

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Temporal Mode Matching**:
   - For the emission profile, apply a filter in the time domain and match it temporally to obtain the measured result.
   - Single-shot measurement data is obtained as $S = X + iP = a + h^\dagger$, where $a$ represents the qubit mode and $h$ represents noise.

 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Histogram Construction**: 
   - Multiple single-shot measurements are taken to construct a distribution histogram.
   - Two cases are measured:
     - Driven qubit state $D_S(\alpha)$.
     - Reference (undriven) state $D_h(\alpha)$.

 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Computing Signal/Noise Moments**: 
   - The moments of the driven state are given as
     $\langle S^{\dagger n} S^m \rangle = \int_S S^{*n} S^m D_S(S)$.
   - The noise moments of the reference state are given by
     $\langle h^n h^{\dagger m} \rangle = \langle S^{\dagger n} S^m \rangle_{D_h}$.

 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Extracting Qubit Moments**: 
   - The expansion formula of signal (with noise) moment is given by
     $\langle S^{\dagger n} S^m \rangle_{\rho_a} =
     \sum_{i,j=0}^{n,m} \binom{m}{j} \binom{n}{i} 
     \langle a^{\dagger i} a^j \rangle
     \langle h^{n-i} h^{\dagger(m-j)} \rangle$.
   - For us having signal moments and noise moments, qubit moments $\langle a^{\dagger n} a^m \rangle$ can be solved by linear equations, recursively.

 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Constructing the Wigner Function**
   - The Wigner function is computed using
     $W(\alpha) = \sum_{n,m} \int d^2\lambda \frac{ \langle (a^\dagger)^n a^m \rangle (-\lambda^*)^m \lambda^n} {\pi^2 n! m!} \exp(-\frac{1}{2} |\lambda|^2 + \alpha \lambda^\ast - \alpha^\ast \lambda)$.

 6Ô∏è‚É£ **Reconstructing the Density Matrix**:
   - The density matrix $\rho$ is obtained using Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE), maximizing the likelihood function
     $\mathcal{L} = - \sum_{n,m} \frac{1}{\delta_{n,m}^2} \left| \langle (a^\dagger)^n a^m \rangle - \text{Tr}(\rho_a (a^\dagger)^n a^m) \right|^2$.
