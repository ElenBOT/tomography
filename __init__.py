"""A set of helper functions and classes to do tomography.

ref: [eth-6886-02]

NOTE: For `examples.ipynb`, drag it to the outside of this folder and run. 
The tomography measurement goes like:
1. Use `measurekit` to measure histogram.
2. Use `postprocess` to compute moment, Winger fuction and density matrix.
3. Use `supportkit` to plot the result and evaluate in-theory ones to compaire with.
